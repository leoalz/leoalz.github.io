## Conclusion

The main result of our analysis is that it is obviously difficult to make precise predictions on the evolution of friendships id users have a few friends on the social media. Indeed, little variations can have a higher impact on our model and affect its performances.

Nevertheless, we were able to predict the future number of friends of each user with acceptable trust ranges. The model of cosine similarity achieved 60% of accuracy while the other model did not exceed 35% of accuracy with an error of one friend.
